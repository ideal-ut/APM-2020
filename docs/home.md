In this course we will study a variety of techniques for predictive analytics, building up from where you were left off in summer. Particular emphasis will be given to (a) a deeper understanding of predictive models, and (b) approaches that are scalable to very large data sets.. Many of these capabilities are essential for handling BIG DATA. Connections to relevant business problems shall be made via example studies. We will mostly be using Python (specially Scikit-Learn), and will also get some experience of Tensorflow/PyTorch, mostly through a substantial project. The central goal of this course is to convey an understanding of the pros and cons of different predictive modeling techniques, so that you can (i) make an informed decision on what approaches to consider when faced with real-life problems requiring predictive modeling, (ii) apply models properly on real datasets so to make valid conclusions. This goal will be reinforced through both theory and hands-on experience.
