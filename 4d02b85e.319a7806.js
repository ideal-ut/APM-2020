PCA is the simplest way of trying to project data into a low dimensional space.  The goal is to reduce dimensionality while keeping as much variance (spread) as you can from the original data.  Think about drawing a line and pressing on either side of that line until you squash all of the data points onto the line.  This line is our principal component (PC), and we are \u2018projecting\u2019 all of the data points onto it.  There are two ways of thinking about how to find the best line: we want to find the line that 1) maximizes the spread of data and 2) minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

Typically, you\u2019ll want to pick enough principal components to cover 90-95% of the variance.  If the first few eigenvalues are much higher than the others, PCA can capture the data using a much lower dimensional space.  If all of the eigenvalues are roughly the same, it means the data falls the same way in every direction and there\u2019s no point in doing PCA.

While Logistic regression is a classification algorithm traditionally limited to only two-class classification problems, if you have more than two classes then Linear Discriminant Analysis is the preferred linear classification technique.
