Feature selection is a data reduction technique that pertains to choosing a subset of the original features thereby reducing the number of predictors.

So, when deciding which subset of features to use, we do so using heuristics which allow for an easier/ simpler solution but not necessarily the optimal one. There are a few ways to go about this, one possibility would be to use a filter method wherein intrinsic quality measures are compared such as the correlation between predictors (in this situation, if the predictors are strongly positively correlated, then one or many of the predictors may not be contributing as much to the seen variance in the model and can be eliminated). Another possibility are wrappers, an extrinsic evaluation technique such as greedy (only making use of some features)  evaluation of a predictive model e.g. a decision tree with a restricted depth. Other wrappers include stepwise and backward elimination (note: backward is generally less applicable than forward for large datasets because computing limitations) which either incrementally add or remove  variables from a model to optimize accuracy.
